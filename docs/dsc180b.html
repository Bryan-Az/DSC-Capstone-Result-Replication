            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p style = "margin:20;">In the field of particle physics, there are a myriad of methodologies for model-making decisions which we need to balance. Due to the properties of the particle-tracking (like lifetime of particles), the process of distinguishing jets and particles requires some helps from artificial intelligence or deep learning. Our project utilized elements of Graph Neural Networks, including convolutional layers such as EdgeConv and GENConv. In Quarter 1 of our project, we looked at how the Deep Sets Neural Network (DSNN) & Fully-connected Neural Network (FCNN) and Designed Decorrelated Taggers (DDT) to predict the Higgs boson particles which is the first elementary particle we found.

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Before having more details of our project, some physics terms need to be explained. A jet is a spray of particles that goes in the same direction. And there are tons of jets when we collide the protons like q/g jet, b jet, W/Z -> qq jet and H->bb jet. Due to the properties of jets, it reproduces the Higgs boson more likely. We need to distinguish the H-> bb jet from all the others. As for the importance of Higgs boson particles, it is the first and only spineless elementary particle observed and the building blocks of the universe while it is the mass givers of other particles. Diving deep into the unknown properties of Higgs boson would definitely help us to understand the existence of universe and something relevant to the dark matter.
